## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The animation simulates a **mass-spring-damper system** in time-domain by:
- Constructing a **physical model** with a mass, spring, and damper.
- Showing a **free-body diagram (FBD)** of forces acting on the mass.
- Deriving the **equation of motion** step-by-step.
- Simulating motion using **Eulerâ€™s numerical method**.
- Displaying a **real-time graph** of position, velocity, and acceleration.

## Functions used from control library

- **spring()**: The spring function is used to construct a helical spring Mobject 
- **damper()**: The damper function is used to construct a damper Mobject
- **mass()**: The mass function is used to construct a rectangular mass element Mobject

## Adjustability
Change the parameters to your liking, this wil automatically change all the visuals to your specific case 
without the need to change the code itself.
