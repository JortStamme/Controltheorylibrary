A Python library using Manim to visualize Control Theory concepts.


This library provides animations to help understand fundamental concepts in Control Theory using Manim. The animations cover topics such as:
Mass-Spring-damper Systems, ...

Example animations which implement the functions provided in this library can be found in the examples folder. 

The functions available in this library are as follows:

create_spring() function: Creates a spring Mobject, possibility to choose between zigzag or helicial type. For implementation, see MassSpringDamperSystem.py 

create_mass() function: Creates a mass Mobject, possibility to choose between rectangular or circular type. For implementation, see MassSpringDamperSystem.py

create_damper() function: Creates a damper Mobject. For implementation, see MassSpringDamperSystem.py
