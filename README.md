Controltheorylib is a Python library designed for creating high-quality mathematical animations related to control theory using Manim. It helps visualize concepts such as transfer functions, Bode plots, Nyquist plots, state-space representations, and system dynamics. Example animations which implement the functions provided in this library can be found in the examples folder.

🔥 Features

🎥 Seamless integration with Manim – Generate smooth mathematical animations for control theory.

📊 Bode, Nyquist, and Root Locus Plots – Easily animate common control theory visualizations.

⚙️ State-Space & Transfer Functions – Convert between system representations and animate system responses.

🔧 Customizable Animations – Adjust colors, styles, and parameters for better visualization.

📖 Usage

Here’s a quick example:

from controltheorylib import control

pzplot = control.pzmap(den,num)
